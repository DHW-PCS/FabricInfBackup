# FabricInfBackup

A Minecraft Fabric mod that allows chunks to be backed up or restored on demand.

Note: Redstone servers are advised to use [QuickBackup](https://github.com/TISUnion/QuickBackupM), a [MCDR](https://github.com/Fallen-Breath/MCDReforged) plugin, when using this mod.

DISCLAIMER: BACKUP YOUR SERVER BEFORE AND WHILE USING THIS MOD. The mod is written based on DHWâ€™s demand, and is NOT yet deployed in ANY of our production Minecraft servers. This mod comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRENTY and you are USING IT AT YOUR OWN RISK. This mod does NOT replace any sort of server backup setup and cannot prevent your worlds or servers from potential corruptions.
